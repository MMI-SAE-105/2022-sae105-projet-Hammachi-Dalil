    <h1>Toy Story 3</h1>
    <img src="../public/img/OIP 2.webp" alt="image toy story 1">
    <p>Toy Story 3 is an animated film from Pixar Studios directed by Lee Unkrich and released in 2010. 
        It is the 3rd in a series of 4 films that were released between 1995 and 2019. 
        It features a bunch of toys that come to life when the child to whom they belong leaves his room. 
    </p>
    <h2>Toy problems </h2>
    <img src="../public/img/jouet 1.webp" alt="image toy story 2">
    <p>In this 3rd installment, Andy, the young man who owns the toys, has grown up and now has to go to college. 
        He has to get rid of these useless things and decide what to do with them. Due to a misunderstanding between him and his mother, 
        the toys end up in a daycare centre, where they first think they are well off before they realise the horror of the place 
        they have landed in, run by a teddy bear who rules the place. 
    </p>
    <p>
        As the characters all know each other, the chemistry between them is well felt, although conflicts do arise. 
        Woody, the main character and Andy's main toy, wants to remain loyal to him and stay in the attic at Andy's disposal 
        in case he needs his toys, while the rest of the toys, thinking that Andy wanted to get rid of them because of a misunderstanding, 
        want to stay at the daycare centre, which they think is the right place for them. The closeness of the toys is further tested when, 
        spoiler alert, Buzz Lightyear is reset and becomes a lieutenant of Losto, the daycare tyrant, and comes to blows with his friends.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>An inspired film</h2>
    <img src="../public/img/woody_1.webp" alt="Image toy story 3">
    <p>The film draws its inspiration from many cinematic works both in its story and in its direction. 
        For example, the villain resembles a parody of the godfather in his way of being and in his story, 
        the whole introductory scene is inspired by western films, the toy phone is clearly a reference to spy films like James Bond.
