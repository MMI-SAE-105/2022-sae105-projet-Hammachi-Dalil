        Disneyland Paris is a theme park created on April 12, 1992. 
        The park has continued to grow in popularity and is now Europe's leading tourist destination. 
        It has 2 theme parks and 7 hotels. It started construction in 1987 and finally opened its doors to the public in 1992. 
        It is one of 15 parks in the USA, France, Japan and China. The park covers 2230 hectares (22.3m²) and is located in Seine-et-Marne.

    <h2>The 30 years of Disneyland Paris</h2>

        Pirates of the Caribbean, which later inspired the well-known film saga, 
        Phantom Manor and Big Thunder Mountain, are among the park's flagship attractions. *
        Also, the park has expanded over time and the various franchise acquisitions by Disney. 
        For example, the Avengers Campus opened in 2022 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Disneyland Paris. 
        For this occasion, Disneyland is proposing a new daytime show called "Let's dream... and everyone lights up", 
        the emblematic Disney characters such as Mickey, Minnie, Donald and Daisy will have new costumes and a light show with drones will be performed at night.

    <h2>A well thought-out strategy</h2>
    <img src="./public/img/disney1 (1).webp" alt="image disneyland 3">
    <p>
        The park is part of a strategy laid out by Walt Disney himself that he envisioned when he created the Disney company. 
        It consists of the films being only a gateway into the company's universe to build loyalty and familiarise customers with the licences 
        and characters created by the company, and then redirecting customers to merchandising or to the Disneyland parks, 
        where they will spend their money and increase the turnover. 
        We understand that licences are the most valuable resource for Disney because their entire strategy is based on them, which explains Disney's 
        aggressiveness on the licence buy-back market.
